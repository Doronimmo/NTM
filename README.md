# Universal Title Manager
A basic title manager for DSi supporting both hiyaCFW and SysNAND, modified from JeffRuLz's Title Manager for HiyaCFW.

## WARNING
This can modify your internal system NAND! There is *always* a risk of **bricking**, albeit small, when you modify NAND. Please proceed with caution.

This has *barely* been tested and should be used with *extreme caution*. Please always use with Unlaunch installed, homebrew installed to the DSi Menu won't work without it and I'm not even sure if DSiWare installed by this will.

## Features
- Install DSiWare and homebrew onto your hiyaCFW SDNAND and SysNAND DSi Menus.

- Delete system titles and others hidden from Data Management on SDNAND.

- Backup and restore installed titles.

- View basic title header info.

## Notes
- Backup your SD card and your NAND! Nothing bad should happen, but this is an early release so who knows.

- This cannot be used to install cartridge games or older DS homebrew.

- This is only for DSi systems. Not 3DS or DS.
