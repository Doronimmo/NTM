# Title Manager for HiyaCFW
TMFH is a DSi homebrew app that can install and delete titles from a DSi emunand.

It is only compatible with DSi systems, not DS or 3DS consoles.

This app includes a modified version of [maketmd by Tuxality](https://github.com/Tuxality/maketmd).

## Usage
Place your dsiware nds and app files in a folder on your SD card called /dsi/.

You cannot install cartridge games, even though they will "successfully" install.
